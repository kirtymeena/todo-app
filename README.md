# Why did I choose to build this project?

I recently started learning SASS and redux toolkit so to test how much I was actually learning I decided to make a simple To-Do app in react, Sass and redux toolkit.

<strong> Take a look at live project [here](https://kirty-todo-app.netlify.app/)</strong> ðŸ‘ˆ

## What did I implement in this project

As my very first redux toolkit and sass project, I decided to keep it simple with basic CURD operations.<br/>
I also wanted to try implementing drag and drop feature but I couldn't so I'll be working on that soon.

### User stories
 <ul>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to create a new todo item.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to check off completed items.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to delete items, so I can remove unwanted tasks</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to see all the todo items I have added and filter on completed and active todos</li>
</ul>

### Defining features
Based on previously defined user stories, I proceeded with the implementation of following features.

<ul>
  <li>Creation of to-do items.</li>
  <li>completion of to-do items.</li>
  <li>Deletion of to-do items.</li>
  <li>Light and dark theme.</li>
  <li>Edit to-do items.</li>
  <li>filtering on completed and active to-do items.</li>
  <li>Responsive design (mobile-first).</li>
  </ul>


### Planned features
<ul>
  <li>re-odering of list using drag and drop.</li>
  <li>storing user data on user device.(this feature have been completed using redux persist)</li>
</ul>

## Lessons learned
Thanks to this project I got to know how much work an application like this one takes.

I learned about HTML semantics and their importance, though I didn't use much of HTML semantics still I read about it and will be using it in future projects.

I used sass in this project but still I can see the repeation of sass code where I could have created a mixin and reused it(will take care of this in next projects).

I have already used redux in other project and I feel like redux toolkit reduces the time and effort of writing code.

The project has a lot of room for improvement but I would just leave it at that and continue with other project and make sure that I don't repeat same mistakes that I did in this one.

I am open to any suggestions about this project.
